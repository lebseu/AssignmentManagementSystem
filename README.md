# Assignments Management System

This is a JSP app managing student assignments, with MySQL as the database.

In this project, UI design is enhanced by Bootstrap, and lots of javascript code is written including Ajax used to call the CRUD services without refreshing the page.

The teacher can use this app to add courses and assignments of students, and modify or delete them smoothly.
